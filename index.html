Suddenly, thanks mainly to Boltzmann, his earlier negative feelings toward education were replaced by a profound love for mathematics and physics. In 1904, he obtained his doctorate from the University of Vienna under Boltzmann's supervision; his dissertation, titled The Motion of Rigid Bodies in Fluids and the Mechanics of Hertz, focused on classical mechanics. Later, Ehrenfest co-developed the Ehrenfest model with Tatiana Ehrenfest to vindicate Boltzmann's work, demonstrating that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is essentially a statistical law rather than an absolute one." },

In 1912, after Bohr returned to Denmark, he adapted Rutherford's nuclear structure to Max Planck's quantum theory and so created his Bohr model of the atom." },

Kapitsa greatly admired Rutherford's straight forward character and pursuit of truth, secretly calling him 'the crocodile' because it was his favorite animal." },

Lise Meitner worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton.
